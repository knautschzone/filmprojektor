A few weeks ago, Elon Musk, in an interview, accidentally blabbed about a cryptocurrency trading robot that brings him passive income from $ 13,000 to $ 135,000 per day and asked to remove this moment from the video after filming.

But the operator who filmed all this remembered the name of the trading robot and tried to make money. 
On the same day, he made a deposit of $ 500 and launched a trading robot and after 3 hours his account had $ 3750 and a week later $ 563700. 
On the robot, you earn in the currency of your country, Europe - EUR, Australia - AUD, Canada - CAD, Sweden - SEC and so on. 
Hurry up to register as after the influx of new users, the administrators decided to stop registering new users from next week.
