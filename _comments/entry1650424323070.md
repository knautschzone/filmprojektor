Hello, 
 
We provide funding through our venture capital company to both start-up 
and existing companies either looking for funding for expansion or to 
accelerate growth in their company. 
We have a structured joint venture investment plan in which we are 
interested in an annual return on investment not more than 10% ROI. 
We are also currently structuring a convertible debt and loan financing 
of 3% interest repayable annually with no early repayment penalties. 
If you have a business plan or executive summary, I can review to 
understand a much better idea of your business and what you are looking 
to do, this will assist in determining the best possible investment 
structure we can pursue and discuss more extensively. 
If you are interested in any of the above, kindly respond to us via this 
email. waheedalgore@alarisinvestmentgroup.org 
 
Sincerely 
Waheed Algore 
Head of Finance 
Al Aris Investment Group
