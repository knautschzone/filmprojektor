I am  a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to the late Mrs. Anna  who used to work with Shell - development company . Hereafter shall be  referred to as my client. 
 
On the 29th  December  2009, my client, his husband and their three  children were involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended  relatives. 
 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last  name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I  contacted you. 
 
The finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about  9.5 million euros has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten  official working days. 
 
Sincerely, 
Barrister   Paco  Martinez (Esq)
