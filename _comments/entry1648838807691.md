I, Ross Ward, have announced my candidacy for South Carolina House District 112 as the Republican nominee and I need your help. 
 
As I complete my 3rd and final year at the prestigious Charleston School of Law, I am awestruck by the poetic language of Our Constitution and the great legal system which emerged from humble origins. Then, I look at the state of our nation and ponder where it all went wrong: 
Skyrocketing gas prices 
Citizens robbed of their civil liberties 
A fraudulently elected President 
Never has the demand for leadership been greater than at this moment. 
I need your help to make a difference: https://bit.ly/ross-ward-for-sc 
 
I am committed to: 
Christian Values 
Putting America First 
A Robust Military 
 
My website is: https://www.rosswardrepublican.com 
 
I am ready to move South Carolina forward by fighting for the values of Donald Trump and the America First movement and against the radical leftist destruction of traditional family values.
